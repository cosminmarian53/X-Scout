Men approach women, buy flowers, serenade, reserve and pay for dinner, open the door, pull out the chair, and they propose. \nWomen are expected to do a lot of things too, and it takes great work, dedication and discipline to be a fine woman, but there‚Äôs very few traditionally romantic gestures that I am aware of that a woman does for a man. She bakes food, gives praise, and then generally just accepts a man‚Äôs gestures with grace, humility and gratitude. \n\nNow if I met a woman that actually did all those things, I would marry her immediately, so again there is great value in what women do. The point of my post here is just that I find it strange that women are painted as the more romantic sex. I think romance is inherently a masculine trait, and that femininity is actually a response to romance. \n\nI think this is why women love romance novels and men are mostly unimpressed by them; women yearn to experience romance, while men yearn to express it. \nMost women are uncomfortable with giving a compliment to a man, and yet they dream of being complimented. Most men are uncomfortable being complimented, and yet they dream of complimenting a woman and being heard, acknowledged and given just the satisfaction of knowing it improved her day; not that compliments are a great indicator of romance but the social behavior is still there. \n\nSo, tldr, men need to reclaim their roles as romantic, vulnerable partners, and women need to stfu and adopt more grace and humility.", "created_at": "Wed Aug 20 06:16:29 +0000 2025", "user_id": "809490783220940806", "user_name": "Quacken üá∫üá∏", "user_screen_name": "duckpile", "retweet_count": 0, "favorite_count": 0, "lang": "en", "keyword_searched": "vulnerability research", "filter_score": 28}
