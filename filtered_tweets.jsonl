The flaw affected WinRAR 7.12 and any software using publicly available Windows UnRAR.dll or its source code that had not updated dependencies. The vulnerability was reported July 24, 2025 and patched in WinRAR 7.13 (beta published same day; full release July 30, 2025).\n\nTargeting occurred via spearphishing (July 18‚Äì21, 2025) against financial, manufacturing, defense and logistics organizations in Europe and Canada using CV-themed attachments. ESET telemetry indicated the actor did not successfully compromise observed targets. Activity is attributed to RomCom (aka Storm-0978/UNC2596/Tropical Scorpius) based on region, TTPs and tooling; RomCom is known to deploy backdoors capable of command execution and modular downloads. A second threat actor also exploited CVE-2025-8088 independently.\n\nThree distinct execution chains were observed. The Mythic agent chain used a malicious LNK (Updater.lnk) to add HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\CLSID\\{1299CF18-C4F5-4B6A-BB0F-2299F0398E27}\\InprocServer32 = %TEMP%\\msedge.dll, leveraging COM hijacking of the PSFactoryBuffer CLSID present in npmproxy.dll so that any process loading it (e.g., Edge) executes the DLL. The DLL AES-decrypts embedded shellcode and enforces a target check by comparing the machine domain name to a hardcoded value, exiting if mismatched.\n\nA SnipBot variant used Display Settings.lnk to run %LOCALAPPDATA%\\ApbxHelper.exe, a modified PuTTY CAC binary signed with an invalid certificate. The loader uses the filename as a key to decrypt strings and shellcode; execution is gated by an anti-analysis check requiring a specific RecentDocs registry value count (sample checked for registry value name \"68\", i.e., >=69 documents). If passed, shellcode downloads the next stage from https://t.co/LAQqlYufM6.\n\nA third chain used Settings.lnk to execute %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Complaint.exe (RustyClaw downloader in Rust, also with an invalid cert) which fetched a payload (SHA-1 01D32FE88ECDEA2B934A00805E138034BF85BF83, internal name install_module_x64.dll) from https://t.co/C7uTdCcIz8; observed MeltingClaw C2 was https://t.co/OgpIx4dld5.", "created_at": "Wed Aug 20 19:23:12 +0000 2025", "user_id": "2990778574", "user_name": "RST Cloud", "user_screen_name": "rst_cloud", "retweet_count": 0, "favorite_count": 0, "lang": "en", "keyword_searched": "vulnerability research", "filter_score": 45}
{"id": "1958270290489737484", "text": "#SoSoScholar2025 @SoSoValueCrypto\nThese Are The Things That I Observed About @SoSoValueCrypto \n\nEveryone knows SoSoValue for clean ETF dashboards and fast market intel, but the bigger play in 2025 is execution. Enter SoDEX, a decentralized exchange plugged directly into SoSoValue‚Äôs research stack, now in public testnet. \n\nWhy this matters. Research without seamless execution leaves alpha on the table. SoDEX is designed to collapse that gap by putting institutional style analytics next to your order ticket, all inside one ecosystem. \n\nThe engine. SoDEX testnet runs a central limit order book on a purpose built chain dubbed ValueChain. That means order transparency on chain with order book style price discovery and lower slippage compared with typical AMM designs. \n\nScope on day one of testnet. Over a hundred spot pairs are live for simulated trading, with experiments in tokenized baskets and indices. That turns SoSoValue‚Äôs index know how into actual tradable markets. \n\nThe data flywheel. SoSoValue already tracks daily spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF flows and market structure. Routing these signals to listing decisions, index baskets, and liquidity programs on SoDEX could create a real information to execution edge. \n\nToken utility gets teeth. SOSO started as an access and governance asset around research and indices. With SoDEX, the token extends into trading utility and incentives, aligning users who analyze, trade, and supply liquidity in one loop. Watch for how rewards are structured. \n\nFunding signal. In January 2025 the team raised fifteen million dollars to expand products and launch multi coin indices. That runway supports exchange grade infra and integrations that are costly to build and maintain. \n\nWhat to track next.\n‚Ä¢ ETF net inflow streaks versus SoDEX spot volumes and new pair performance\n‚Ä¢ Index methodology updates and any migration into live index markets on SoDEX\n‚Ä¢ App adoption trends from the mobile side feeding testnet users into mainnet at launch. \n\nToken supply reality check. Circulating supply is a little over one hundred fifteen million out of one billion, with scheduled unlocks to monitor. Map unlock dates against major SoDEX milestones to separate signal from noise around price. \n\nCompliance and product design. Tokenized indices and stock style markets are compelling, but they require careful venue design and jurisdiction aware access. Expect a phased rollout that prioritizes transparent on chain settlement with conservative perimeter features first. (Inference based on current testnet scope and public materials.) \n\nRisk sheet for 2025. Exchange centralization risks, bridge exploits, and narrative overreach remain live issues across crypto. SoDEX‚Äôs choice of on chain CLOB with explorer level auditability is one partial answer, but security reviews and stress tests will matter. \n\nHow to get hands on. Join the testnet whitelist, claim from the faucet, and trade the sandbox to learn the UX and find gaps worth reporting. Early users can earn reputational and incentive upside while shaping mainnet polish. \n\nMy base case. If SoSoValue lands clean integrations between ETF flow analytics, index research, and SoDEX order routing, it can become the first widely used research to execution loop in crypto that feels institutional but remains open to retail.\n\nFinal thought. Many exchanges talk about insight led trading. SoSoValue is building it as a product. If the testnet iteration pace holds and funding is deployed with focus, this could be one of 2025‚Äôs most interesting exchange launches to actually use.", "created_at": "Wed Aug 20 20:49:54 +0000 2025", "user_id": "1663520544858292224", "user_name": "Jamie_Paulson", "user_screen_name": "MitchMac112096", "retweet_count": 0, "favorite_count": 0, "lang": "en", "keyword_searched": "decentralized exchange", "filter_score": 36}

UNC5518 predominantly exploits legitimate websites by serving fake CAPTCHA verification pages to distribute a downloader script, initiating a malware infection chain. This financial-driven group often collaborates with other actors who utilize the access gained for further malicious deployments.\n\nCORNFLAKE.V3 manifests in two variations, written in either JavaScript or PHP. It retrieves payloads through HTTP, allowing it to execute various file types, including shell commands, executables, and dynamic link libraries (DLLs). The backdoor is capable of gathering basic system information and transmitting it to a remote server, with the added capability to misuse Cloudflare Tunnels to proxy traffic. The malware has shown a capacity for persistence and can ensure that only one instance is running concurrently.\n\nUpon execution, CORNFLAKE.V3 performs initial checks and collects system information before establishing a connection to its command-and-control (C2) server. It utilizes two lists (hosts and hostsIP) to manage its communication, attempting to connect to random entries from these lists. The main function of the backdoor sends an initial POST request to the C2 server, carrying encrypted system information and execution results. For persistence, it leverages the command-line arguments of the \"node.exe\" process, extracting and writing the initial malicious script to a log file in the Node.js installation directory.\n\nThe malware can execute a variety of payloads. Notably, it has been observed conducting Active Directory reconnaissance, which includes activities such as counting the number of computer objects in a domain, displaying detailed user context, enumerating domain trusts, listing domain controllers, and querying service principal names (SPNs). The second significant capability is Kerberoasting, where it queries for user accounts associated with SPNs to harvest credentials. Password hashes obtained through this technique are exfiltrated to the C2 server for potential cracking.\n\nA recent variant of CORNFLAKE.V3 implemented in PHP has emerged, maintaining similar functionalities as the original Node.js version. Additionally, after interactions with the C2 server, the backdoor retrieves a DLL payload, specifically the WINDYTWIST.SEA backdoor, which is then executed, further expanding its capabilities in the compromised environment.\n\nThe investigation underscores the collaborative dynamics of modern cyber threats, illustrating how UNC5518 capitalizes on compromised sites while other groups like UNC5774 deploy versatile malware to further operational goals. The focus on reconnaissance and credential theft suggests a clear intention for lateral movement within targeted networks, emphasizing the evolving complexity and danger posed by such threat actors.", "created_at": "Wed Aug 20 21:23:50 +0000 2025", "user_id": "2990778574", "user_name": "RST Cloud", "user_screen_name": "rst_cloud", "retweet_count": 0, "favorite_count": 0, "lang": "en", "keyword_searched": "threat intelligence", "filter_score": 28}

Men approach women, buy flowers, serenade, reserve and pay for dinner, open the door, pull out the chair, and they propose. \nWomen are expected to do a lot of things too, and it takes great work, dedication and discipline to be a fine woman, but there‚Äôs very few traditionally romantic gestures that I am aware of that a woman does for a man. She bakes food, gives praise, and then generally just accepts a man‚Äôs gestures with grace, humility and gratitude. \n\nNow if I met a woman that actually did all those things, I would marry her immediately, so again there is great value in what women do. The point of my post here is just that I find it strange that women are painted as the more romantic sex. I think romance is inherently a masculine trait, and that femininity is actually a response to romance. \n\nI think this is why women love romance novels and men are mostly unimpressed by them; women yearn to experience romance, while men yearn to express it. \nMost women are uncomfortable with giving a compliment to a man, and yet they dream of being complimented. Most men are uncomfortable being complimented, and yet they dream of complimenting a woman and being heard, acknowledged and given just the satisfaction of knowing it improved her day; not that compliments are a great indicator of romance but the social behavior is still there. \n\nSo, tldr, men need to reclaim their roles as romantic, vulnerable partners, and women need to stfu and adopt more grace and humility.", "created_at": "Wed Aug 20 06:16:29 +0000 2025", "user_id": "809490783220940806", "user_name": "Quacken üá∫üá∏", "user_screen_name": "duckpile", "retweet_count": 0, "favorite_count": 0, "lang": "en", "keyword_searched": "vulnerability research", "filter_score": 28}
